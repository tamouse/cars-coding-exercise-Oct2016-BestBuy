# Cars

## Code Scenario Requirements:

### Base Car Class

* current speed (property) – default value 0
* accelerate (method)
* drive (method)
* brand (property) - default value ‘unknown’
* max speed (property) - default value 0

### Camaro Car Class

* Inherits Base Car
* brand (property) - default value ‘Chevy’
* max speed (property) – default value 200

### Code Scenario:

In this example we will create an instance of Camaro and tell it to
drive, we will assume it’s moving in a straight line and there are no
other driving factors. The car will accelerate until it hits its max
speed. It is required that drive will call accelerate. It is required
accelerate will increment the current speed by 1. Once the Camaro
reaches max speed it should stop accelerating and print that it hit
the cars max speed. The execution of drive should then also stop.


## Usage:

    $ bundle install
    $ rake
    $ rake drive:camaro
